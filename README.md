This is a collection of algorithms and data structures I am working on to
prepare for the inevitable graph question in the next interview but also
because I like them in general.

They are neither, space efficient, complete or fast!

That may come later but the current goal is to learn and get them working
with tests and benchmarks.

### Tree Data Structures

- [o] Binary search tree
	- [x] insert
	- [ ] delete
	- [x] find
	- [ ] find min/max
	- [ ] BFS, DFS traversal
	- [ ] prefix, postfix and infix rendering
	- [ ] tests
	- [ ] benchmarks

- [ ] B-Tree
- [ ] AVL tree
- [ ] Trie/Prefix tree
- [ ] Radix tree
- [ ] Merkle tree
- [ ] Red-Black tree (if I'm crazy enough)

### Algorithms

- [ ] A*
- [ ] Dijkstra
